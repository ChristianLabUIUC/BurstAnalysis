# BurstAnalysis
Use this code to construct ISI scatter plot and histogram of ISI values, identify optimal burst ISI threshold, identify which neurons are bursting neurons, and evaluate bursting neurons for detailed burst properties.

Run PlotBursts to see the cumulative distribution of burst duration, # of spikes in the burst, firing rate in the burst, and interburst intervals.

Functions findbursts and bursts are called by PlotBursts.

Example spike time data come from targeted extracellular recordings of gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons from diestrous and estrous mice
